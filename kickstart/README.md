* The web interface of the kickstart project is going to involve next.js
* This wraps around react to create a multi-page web app for our ethereum project
* React alone only manages single page application. Like we did in the lottery contract
* We are going to have a 'pages' directory for next. And each file inside the pages directory will be a react component
* We then need to figure out how to setup routing for the relevant page view
